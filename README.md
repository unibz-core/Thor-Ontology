# ThOR Ontology

The objective of **ThOR Ontology** is to provide a vocabulary for building lexicons and thesauri for a same domain. The OWL implementation of the ThOR Ontology is designed to provide an implementation artifact to structure a knowledge base (or knowledge graph), being suitable for Semantic Web and Linked Data applications. The ThOR Ontology uses concepts from [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/), [Ontolex](https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/), and [Lexinfo](https://github.com/ontolex/lexinfo), complementing them for accomplishing the purpose of being used for representing a lexicon that can be further transformed into a thesaurus using a specific tool built for this purpose, the [Ontolex2SKOS](https://github.com/unibz-core/ontolex2skos).

ThOR stands for “Thesaurus and Ontology Representation”. The ThOR Project was a collaboration project that happened in 2021 between the [*Zorginstituut Nederland* (ZIN)](https://english.zorginstituutnederland.nl/) – the Dutch National Health Care Institute – and the [Conceptual and Cognitive Modeling Research Group (CORE)](https://www.inf.unibz.it/krdb/core/) from the [Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (Unibz)](https://unibz.it/).
